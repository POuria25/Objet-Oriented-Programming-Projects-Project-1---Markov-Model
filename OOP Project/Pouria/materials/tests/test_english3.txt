before entering on the sub ect of this chapter i must make a fe  preliminar  remarks to sho  ho  the struggle for e istence bears on natural selection. it has been seen in the last chapter that among organic beings in a state of nature there is some individual variabilit . indeed i am not a are that this has ever been disputed. it is immaterial for us  hether a multitude of doubtful forms be called species or sub species or varieties.  hat rank, for instance, the t o or three hundred doubtful forms of british plants are entitled to hold, if the e istence of an   ell marked varieties be admitted. but the mere e istence of individual variabilit  and of some fe   ell marked varieties, though necessar  as the foundation for the  ork, helps us but little in understanding ho  species arise in nature. ho  have all those e  uisite adaptations of one part of the organisation to another part, and to the conditions of life and of one organic being to another being, been perfected   e see these beautiful co adaptations most plainl  in the  oodpecker and the mistletoe. and onl  a little less plainl  in the humblest parasite  hich clings to the hairs of a  uadruped or feathers of a bird. in the structure of the beetle  hich dives through the  ater. in the plumed seed  hich is  afted b  the gentlest bree e. in short,  e see beautiful adaptations ever  here and in ever  part of the organic  orld. again, it ma  be asked, ho  is it that varieties,  hich i have called incipient species, become ultimatel  converted into good and distinct species,  hich in most cases obviousl  differ from each other far more than do the varieties of the same species  ho  do those groups of species,  hich constitute  hat are called distinct genera and  hich differ from each other more than do the species of the same genus, arise  all these results, as  e shall more full  see in the ne t chapter, follo  from the struggle for life. o ing to this struggle, variations, ho ever slight and from  hatever cause proceeding, if the  be in an  degree profitable to the individuals of a species, in their infinitel  comple  relations to other organic beings and to their ph sical conditions of life,  ill tend to the preservation of such individuals, and  ill generall  be inherited b  the offspring. the offspring, also,  ill thus have a better chance of surviving, for, of the man  individuals of an  species  hich are periodicall  born, but a small number can survive. i have called this principle, b   hich each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, b  the term natural selection, in order to mark its relation to man s po er of selection. but the e pression often used b  mr. herbert spencer, of the survival of the fittest, is more accurate, and is sometimes e uall  convenient.  e have seen that man b  selection can certainl  produce great results, and can adapt organic beings to his o n uses, through the accumulation of slight but useful variations, given to him b  the hand of nature. but natural selection,  e shall hereafter see, is a po er incessantl  read  for action, and is as immeasurabl  superior to man s feeble efforts, as the  orks of nature are to those of art.
