but  e had to change our purpose about san miguel, for a storm came up about noon that so tossed and pitched the vessel that common sense dictated a run for shelter. therefore  e steered for the nearest island of the group,fa al  the people there pronounce it f  all, and put the accent on the first s llable .  e anchored in the open roadstead of horta, half a mile from the shore. the to n has eight thousand to ten thousand inhabitants. its sno   hite houses nestle cosil  in a sea of fresh green vegetation, and no village could look prettier or more attractive. it sits in the lap of an amphitheater of hills  hich are three hundred to seven hundred feet high, and carefull  cultivated clear to their summits,not a foot of soil left idle. ever  farm and ever  acre is cut up into little s uare inclosures b  stone  alls,  hose dut  it is to protect the gro ing products from the destructive gales that blo  there. these hundreds of green s uares, marked b  their black lava  alls, make the hills look like vast checkerboards. the islands belong to portugal, and ever thing in fa al has portuguese characteristics about it. but more of that anon. a s arm of s arth , nois , l ing, shoulder shrugging, gesticulating portuguese boatmen,  ith brass rings in their ears and fraud in their hearts, climbed the ship s sides, and various parties of us contracted  ith them to take us ashore at so much a head, silver coin of an  countr .  e landed under the  alls of a little fort, armed  ith batteries of t elve and thirt  t o pounders,  hich horta considered a most formidable institution, but if  e  ere ever to get after it  ith one of our turreted monitors, the   ould have to move it out in the countr  if the   anted it  here the  could go and find it again  hen the  needed it. the group on the pier  as a rust  one,men and  omen, and bo s and girls, all ragged and barefoot, uncombed and unclean, and b  instinct, education, and profession beggars. the  trooped after us, and never more  hile  e tarried in fa al did  e get rid of them.  e  alked up the middle of the principal street, and these vermin surrounded us on all sides and glared upon us. and ever  moment e cited couples shot ahead of the procession to get a good look back,  ust as village bo s do  hen the  accompan  the elephant on his advertising trip from street to street. it  as ver  flattering to me to be part of the material for such a sensation. here and there in the door a s  e sa   omen  ith fashionable portuguese hoods on. this hood is of thick blue cloth, attached to a cloak of the same stuff, and is a marvel of ugliness. it stands up high and spreads far abroad, and is unfathomabl  deep. it fits like a circus tent, and a  oman s head is hidden a a  in it like the man s  ho prompts the singers from his tin shed in the stage of an opera. there is no particle of trimming about this monstrous capote, as the  call it,it is  ust a plain, ugl  dead blue mass of sail, and a  oman can t go  ithin eight points of the  ind  ith one of them on. she has to go before the  ind or not at all. the general st le of the capote is the same in all the islands, and  ill remain so for the ne t ten thousand  ears, but each island shapes its capotes  ust enough differentl  from the others to enable an observer to tell at a glance  hat particular island a lad  hails from.
